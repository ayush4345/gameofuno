## Setup Instructions

### Frontend (Next.js app)
1. Navigate to the `unogameui` folder:
   ```bash
   cd unogameui
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend (Socket server)
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the socket server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Ensure both the frontend and backend are running simultaneously for the application to function properly.
